# Image-recognition-to-detect-expression
Using CNN,the different expressions of faces are detected and classified



Software/Package Requirments
Python 2.7
Keras
Pandas
Numpy

For this project,I used Keros package with Tensorflow as background to construct a convolutional neural network with two hidden layers with dropout to prevent overfitting.The data is in the form of images of various actors obtained from IMFD database.The script gives a moderate accuracy of 60% .
